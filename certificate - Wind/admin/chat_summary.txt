During this session, we focused on troubleshooting and fixing various errors in the certificate validation web application's admin panel. Key tasks included addressing constant redefinition issues, HTTP 500 errors, and ensuring all necessary files were included correctly. We implemented a series of fixes, including updating the security header and configuration files, creating a master initialization file, and ensuring that constants are defined only once. Despite several attempts, constant redefinition warnings persisted, leading to the creation of a comprehensive diagnostic and fix script to streamline the process. The session concluded with a plan to verify the fixes by testing various admin panel pages.
